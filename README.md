# About this repo:

This repo is maintained by me (@timsinashok) and contains my work as **undergraduate summer researcher** in **Shared Sensor Lab, NYU Tandon** for the project **Floodnet**. 

# What is Floodnet?

FloodNet is a collaborative project that combines the efforts of academic institutions, government organizations, and community advocacy groups to address urban flooding in New York City. It involves deploying a network of low-cost and low-power flood-level sensors to collect quantitative flood-level data. This is then made available through a public-facing data dashboard. 

Here are relevant links to the project:
