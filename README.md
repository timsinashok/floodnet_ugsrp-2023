# What is Floodnet?

FloodNet is a collaborative project that combines the efforts of academic institutions, government organizations, and community advocacy groups to address urban flooding in New York City. It involves deploying a network of low-cost and low power flood level sensors to collect quantitative data on flood levels, which is then made available through a public-facing data dashboard.
